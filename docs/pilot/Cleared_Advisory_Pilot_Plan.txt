Cleared Advisory Pilot Plan — Self-Reported Clearance Model

🚀 Key Change
We do not validate, confirm, or maintain clearance records. All clearance details are self-reported by candidates at registration, with a disclaimer making it clear that:
- Candidates are responsible for providing accurate, current information.
- Employers/recruiters must independently verify all clearance claims before hiring.

TL;DR — Top 7 Priorities
1. Liability protection (non-negotiable): Privacy policy, Terms of Service, data handling rules, and a self-report disclaimer stating we do not validate clearance levels.
2. Demand before supply: Lock 3–5 anchor employers (LOIs or emails confirming participation) with 20–50 active reqs.
3. Supply seed: Recruit 75–150 cleared professionals who self-report clearance type and dates.
4. Concierge matching ops: Manual matching workflow using candidate profiles + job requirements; recruiters verify details on their end.
5. Clear success metrics: Time-to-first-match (<48h), interview rate (≥25%), employer satisfaction (NPS ≥40).
6. Pricing experiment: Test free-to-paid transition and see which model sticks after pilot.
7. Instrumentation: Simple tracking sheet + weekly reporting for matches, interviews, and offers.
