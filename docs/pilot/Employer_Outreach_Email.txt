ClearedAdvisor Pilot Program — Employer Outreach Email (Mail Merge Template)

Subject: Invitation to Join the ClearedAdvisor Pilot Program

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out to invite [Company Name] to be one of just a handful of launch partners for the ClearedAdvisor Pilot Program — a new platform designed to connect employers with qualified cleared professionals faster and more efficiently.

Here's what you get as a pilot partner:
- Curated matches from a pool of self-reported cleared candidates for up to 10 job requisitions.
- Zero long-term commitment — the pilot lasts just 4 weeks.
- Early access to a streamlined hiring model designed specifically for cleared roles.

What we ask from you:
- Provide 5–10 active cleared job requisitions.
- Give timely feedback (within 72 hours) on matches we send.
- Acknowledge that clearance details are self-reported, and you'll handle verification before hire.

Pilot runs: [Start Date] → [End Date]
Pricing: You'll be part of a pricing experiment, ranging from free to a small success fee.

If you're interested, I've attached our Letter of Intent (LOI) with full details. Signing it simply confirms your participation — it's non-binding and focused on testing the model together.

Can we set up a quick 15-minute call this week to confirm your spot?

Best regards,
