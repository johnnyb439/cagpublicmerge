To: [Employer Name]
From: ClearedAdvisor Team

Introduction
Thank you for your interest in joining the ClearedAdvisor Pilot Program. This 4-week initiative is designed to test and refine a new model for connecting employers with cleared professionals in a faster, more targeted way.

Pilot Purpose
The purpose of this pilot is to validate a streamlined, two-sided marketplace that helps employers fill cleared positions by receiving curated matches from a pool of self-reported cleared candidates.

Pilot Duration
The pilot will run for 4 weeks, starting on [Start Date] and ending on [End Date].

ClearedAdvisor's Commitment
- Provide a curated list of qualified candidates for up to 10 active job requisitions.
- Source candidates whose clearance information is self-reported during profile creation.
- Facilitate candidate introductions and track feedback loops for continuous improvement.

Employer's Commitment
- Provide 5–10 active, cleared job requisitions during the pilot period.
- Respond to candidate matches with feedback within 72 hours.
- Acknowledge and agree that the Employer is solely responsible for verifying all candidate clearance information prior to making any hiring decision. ClearedAdvisor does not validate, verify, or confirm clearance details.

Pricing
As a pilot partner, you will participate in a pricing experiment and will be assigned one of several models, ranging from free access to a reduced pilot fee or pay-for-results structure.

ClearedAdvisor Pilot Pricing Models to Test

1. Launch Partner (Free Model)
Description: Employers receive full access to curated candidate matches for free during the pilot period.
Hypothesis: Removing financial barriers will maximize participation and yield high engagement/feedback rates, helping refine the platform before monetization.

2. Pay-for-Results Model
Description: Employers pay only when a match results in a measurable outcome — e.g., $100 per interview scheduled or $500 per hire.
Hypothesis: Performance-based fees align incentives and will encourage employers to actively evaluate and move candidates through their hiring process.

3. Discounted Subscription Model
Description: Employers pay a flat, heavily discounted monthly subscription (e.g., $299/month) for unlimited curated matches during the pilot.
Hypothesis: Even a small upfront cost will help measure employer commitment and filter for serious participants, while testing willingness to pay for ongoing access.
